# Laptops_data_analyst

In this project, I am analyzing a dataset containing information about laptops from online stores. The analysis process consists of data cleaning, data visualization, selection of variables for the model and construction of the ML model along with its evaluation. During the analysis, I wonder what parameters affect the price of laptops.
